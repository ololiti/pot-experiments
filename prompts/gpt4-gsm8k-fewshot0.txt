# Question: Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

# Solution:
# Q1: What is the total profit she makes?
# E1: This equals the number of eggs she sells, times the price per egg.
# Fact: The price per egg is $2
price_per_egg = 2
# Q2: What is the number of eggs she sells?
# E2: This equals the total number of eggs minus the eggs she eats or bakes muffins with.
# Fact: The ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
total_eggs = 16
# Fact: She eats 3 for breakfast.
breakfast_eggs = 3
# Fact: She uses 4 for muffins.
muffin_eggs = 4
sold_eggs = total_eggs - breakfast_eggs - muffin_eggs #E2
profit = sold_eggs*price_per_egg #E1
# Our final answer is the profit she makes.
ans = profit

# Question: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?

# Solution:
# Q1: How many bolts of fiber does the robe take?
# E1: This equals the number of bolts of blue fiber, plus the number of bolts of white fiber.
# Fact: The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
blue_fiber = 2
# Q2: What is the number of bolts of white fiber?
# E2: This equals half the number of bolts of blue fiber.
white_fiber = blue_fiber/2 #E2
total_fiber = blue_fiber + white_fiber #E1
# Our final answer is the total amount of fiber this takes.
ans = total_fiber

# Question: Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining distance?

# Solution:
# Q1: What should her speed be for the rest of the hike?
# E1: Her speed should be the remaining distance divided by the remaining time.
# Q2: What is the remaining distance?
# E2: The remaining distance is the total distance, minus the distance walked so far.
# Fact: The total distance is 12 miles.
total_distance = 12
# Fact: The distance walked so far is 4 miles plus 2 miles.
distance_walked = 4 + 2
remaining_distance = total_distance - distance_walked #E2
# Q3: What is the remaining time?
# E3: The remaining time is the total time minus the time walked so far.
# Q4: What is the total time?
# E4: The total time is the total distance, divided by the desired speed.
# Fact: The desired speed is 4 miles per hour.
desired_speed = 4
total_time = total_distance/desired_speed #E4
# Fact: The time walked so far is 1 hour plus 1 hour.
time_walked = 1 + 1
remaining_time = total_time - time_walked #E3
speed = remaining_distance/remaining_time #E1
# The final answer is the speed for the rest of the hike.
ans = speed

# Question: Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?

# Solution:
# Q1: How many years will it take to make a profit on the tree?
# E1: This equals the number of years it takes to make up the initial cost of the tree.
# Fact: The initial cost of the tree is $90.
initial_cost = 90
# Q2: How many years will it take to make the initial cost of the tree?
# E2: This equals the initial cost, divided by the profit per year.
# Q3: What is the profit per year?
# E3: This equals the amount he makes from selling lemons, minus the amount it costs to water and feed the tree.
# Q4: How much does he make per year from selling lemons?
# E4: This equals the number of lemons per year times the profit per lemon.
# Fact: There are 7 lemons per year.
lemons_per_year = 7
# Fact: He sells each lemon for $1.50.
profit_per_lemon = 1.5
lemon_profit_per_year = lemons_per_year*profit_per_lemon #E4
# Fact: It costs $3 per year to water and feed the tree.
water_cost = 3
profit_per_year = lemon_profit_per_year - water_cost #E3
years = initial_cost/profit_per_year
# The final answer is the number of years, rounded up to the nearest integer
ans = math.ceil(years)
