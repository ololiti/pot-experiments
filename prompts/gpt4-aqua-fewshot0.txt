# Question: In a flight of 600 km, an aircraft was slowed down due to bad weather. Its average speed for the trip was reduced by 200 km/hr and the time of flight increased by 30 minutes. The duration of the flight is:
# Answer option: ['A)1 hour', 'B)2 hours', 'C)3 hours', 'D)4 hours', 'E)5 hours']

# Solution:
# We are trying to find the flight duration.
# First, we define the variable we are trying to solve.
duration = Symbol("duration", positive=True)
# Then, we will define all the other variables we know.
# We are told that the distance is 600km.
distance = 600
# We know that speed is distance/duration.
speed = distance/duration
# We know that the delayed speed is the speed minus 200km/hr.
delayed_speed = speed - 200
# We also know that the delayed time is the duration plus 30 minutes. Since we are working in terms of hours, we will divide by 60.
delayed_time = duration + 30/60
# Then, we also know that the delayed speed equals the distance divided by the delayed time.
# Since we have already defined the delayed speed, we can use this to solve for the duration.
ans = solve(delayed_speed - (distance/delayed_time), duration)
