# Question: Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

# Solution:
# We want to find her total profit.
# We are given the following information:
eggs_per_day = 16
breakfast_eggs = 3
muffin_eggs = 4
price_per_egg = 2
# Her total profit is the eggs remaining after cooking, times the price per egg.
eggs_remaining = eggs_per_day - breakfast_eggs - muffin_eggs
profit = price_per_egg*eggs_remaining
ans = profit

# Question: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?

# Solution:
# We want to find the total number of bolts.
# We know the following information:
blue_fiber = 2
# The number of bolts of white fiber equals half the number of bolts of blue fiber.
white_fiber = blue_fiber/2 
# The total number of bolts is the amount of blue fiber plus the amount of white fiber.
total_fiber = blue_fiber + white_fiber 
ans = total_fiber
