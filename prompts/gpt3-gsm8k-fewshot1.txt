# Question: Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

# Solution:
# E1: Her total profit is the number of eggs she sells, times the price per egg.
price_per_egg = 2
# E2: The number of eggs she sells equals the total number of eggs minus the eggs she eats or bakes muffins with.
total_eggs = 16
breakfast_eggs = 3
muffin_eggs = 4
sold_eggs = total_eggs - breakfast_eggs - muffin_eggs #E2
profit = sold_eggs*price_per_egg #E1
ans = profit

# Question: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?

# Solution:
# E1: The total number of bolts equals the number of bolts of blue fiber, plus the number of bolts of white fiber.
blue_fiber = 2
# E2: The number of bolts of white fiber equals half the number of bolts of blue fiber.
white_fiber = blue_fiber/2 #E2
total_fiber = blue_fiber + white_fiber #E1
ans = total_fiber

# Question: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?

# Solution:
# E1: His total profit is the new value of the house minus his total costs.
# E2: The new value of the house is the original value plus 150% of the original value
orig_value = 80000
new_value = orig_value + orig_value*1.5 #E2
# E3: His total cost is the original value of the house plus the cost of repairs.
repair_cost = 50000
total_cost = orig_value + repair_cost #E3
total_profit = new_value - total_cost #E1
ans = total_profit

# Question: James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?

# Solution:
# E1: The total number of meters per week is the total number of meters per sprint, times the total number of sprints per week.
meters_per_sprint = 60
# E2: The total number of sprints per week is 3*3
sprints_per_week = 3*3 #E2
meters_per_week = meters_per_sprint*sprints_per_week #E1
ans = meters_per_week
