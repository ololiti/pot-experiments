# You are teaching an introductory math class. One of your students has written the following Python code to answer a math problem, which may or may not be correct.
# If this is a correct solution to the math problem, respond with just the word "correct."
# If this is not a correct solution, please write Python code which correctly computes the answer and stores it in the variable "ans."
# Make sure to redefine all variables you are using, and comment your code in the following format:

# Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
# Answer Options: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']

# Solution: 
# Q1: How long will it take for the car to reach the tower?
# E1: This equals the distance it has to the tower, divided by its speed.
# Q2: What is the distance it has to the tower?
# R2: The car, the base of the tower, and the top of the tower form a right triangle with an angle of 60 degrees.
# E2: This means that the car's distance to the tower and the tower height form a 1:sqrt(3) ratio.
tower_height = Symbol("tower_height", positive=True)
distance = tower_height/sympy.sqrt(3) #E2
# Q3: What is its speed?
# E3: This equals the distance it traveled in the past 10 minutes, divided by 10.
# Q4: What is the distance it traveled?
# E4: This equals its distance 10 minutes ago minus its distance now.
# Q5: What was its distance 10 minutes ago?
# R5: Ten minutes ago, the car, the base of the tower, and the top of the tower formed a right triange with an angle of 45 degrees.
# E5: This means that the car's distance to the tower and the tower height formed a 1:1 ratio.
old_distance = tower_height #E5
distance_traveled = old_distance - distance #E4
speed = distance_traveled/10 #E3
# R1: Since the tower height is a variable in both the speed and the distance, we can use simplify to cancel it out.
time = simplify(distance/speed) #E1
ans = time
