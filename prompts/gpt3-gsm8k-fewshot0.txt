# Question: Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

# Solution:
# E1: Her total profit is the number of eggs she sells, times the price per egg.
price_per_egg = 2
# E2: The number of eggs she sells equals the total number of eggs minus the eggs she eats or bakes muffins with.
total_eggs = 16
breakfast_eggs = 3
muffin_eggs = 4
sold_eggs = total_eggs - breakfast_eggs - muffin_eggs #E2
profit = sold_eggs*price_per_egg #E1
ans = profit

# Question: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?

# Solution:
# E1: The total number of bolts equals the number of bolts of blue fiber, plus the number of bolts of white fiber.
blue_fiber = 2
# E2: The number of bolts of white fiber equals half the number of bolts of blue fiber.
white_fiber = blue_fiber/2 #E2
total_fiber = blue_fiber + white_fiber #E1
ans = total_fiber

# Question: Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining distance?

# Solution:
# E1: Her remaining speed should be the remaining distance divided by the remaining time.
# E2: The remaining distance is the total distance, minus the distance walked so far.
total_distance = 12
distance_walked = 4 + 2
remaining_distance = total_distance - distance_walked #E2
# E3: The remaining time is the total time minus the time walked so far.
# E4: The total time is the total distance, divided by the desired speed.
desired_speed = 4
total_time = total_distance/desired_speed #E4
time_walked = 1 + 1
remaining_time = total_time - time_walked #E3
speed = remaining_distance/remaining_time #E1
ans = speed

# Question: Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?

# Solution:
# E1: The number of years it takes to make a profit equals the number of years it takes to make up the initial cost of the tree, plus 1.
# E2: The number of years it takes to make up the initial cost equals the initial cost, divided by the profit per year.
initial_cost = 90
# E3: The profit per year equals the amount he makes from selling lemons, minus the amount it costs to water and feed the tree.
# E4: The amount he makes from selling lemons equals the number of lemons per year times the profit per lemon.
lemons_per_year = 7
profit_per_lemon = 1.5
lemon_profit_per_year = lemons_per_year*profit_per_lemon #E4
water_cost = 3
profit_per_year = lemon_profit_per_year - water_cost #E3
make_up_years = initial_cost/profit_per_year #E2
total_years = make_up_years + 1 #E1
# The final answer is the number of years, rounded down to the nearest integer
ans = math.floor(total_years)
